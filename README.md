## IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER SAVE IN THE BELOW FOLDER YOU CARE ABOUT, BACK IT UP BOI ##
STEP 1: Start Enshrouded, CREATE new world and LAUNCH the world, then quit to desktop once loaded.

STEP 2: Open '\Steam\userdata\\#*steam account number*#\1203620\remote', make note of the world number of the newest two files created, will be something like '1ab23cde' and '1ab23cde_info'.

STEP 3: Download latest release and copy into 1203620\remote\ folder

STEP 4: Rename files from github download to the same world number as noted from step 2.
Make sure you keep track of which file is which

*Basically, if downloaded github world number is '9zy87xwu' and created world number from step 1 is '1ab23cde' then the end result would be '9zy87xwu' being RENAMED to '1ab23cde'*

STEP 5: Relaunch game and enjoy :)



After transfer, folder should have '1203620\remote\\#worldnumber#' and '1203620\remote\\#worldnumber_info#' files (plus extra character file, but that doesn't seem to need to be transferred)
