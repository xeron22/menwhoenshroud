## IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER SAVE IN THE BELOW FOLDER YOU CARE ABOUT, BACK IT UP BOI ##

copy the above files into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\***account number***\1203620\remote

***Note: This will be a random looking number (IF YOU HAVE MULTI ACCOUNTS JUST GO INTO EACH ONE TILL YOU FIND)

After transfer folder should have 3bd85c7d_info and 3bd85c7d files (plus extra character file, but that doesn't seem to need to be transferred)
